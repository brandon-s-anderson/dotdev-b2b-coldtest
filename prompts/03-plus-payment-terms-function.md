# 3. Plus payment-terms Function  [Plus]

This is the Plus differentiator for the single-location mixed cart. A payment-customization
Function detects a pre-book item in the cart and, for that checkout only:

1. switches payment terms from Net 30 to due-on-fulfillment (`paymentTermsSet`), and
2. hides the deferred "choose payment method at a later time" option to force a vaulted card.

## Why Plus

- The `paymentTermsSet` operation is Plus + B2B only.
- On non-Plus, a static location default handles the terms (the pre-book location is set to
  due-on-fulfillment), and force-vaulting comes from an **App Store (public) app**, because
  custom apps that contain Functions require Plus.

## Scaffold (already in the starter)

The starter already includes `extensions/prebooking-payment-terms/` with a stub Function and stub
input query. You implement the query + logic there. You do **not** need to open those files to follow
along; the teach callouts below show what matters.

## Prompt (copy the whole fence into your AI)

> **Speed it up.** This build is **edit-only**, `shopify app dev` rebuilds the Function on save, so the
> AI only needs to edit `src/` files; it does **not** need to run `function build`, `deploy`, or any
> command. Before you paste, put your AI tool in **auto-accept edits** (Claude Code: Shift+Tab to
> "auto-accept edits on"; Cursor: enable Auto-Run). The starter ships `.claude/settings.json` that does
> this for Claude Code automatically. Commands still prompt, so decline any the AI proposes.

```text
Implement the `cart.payment-methods.transform.run` target.

Follow these constraints so the build stays fast:
- Edit only the files in `src/` (the `.ts` and its `.graphql` input query). dev is running and rebuilds on save.
- Do NOT run any CLI commands. Do NOT wait for or inspect `generated/api.ts` (type codegen is a separate step that does not hot-reload; write against the query below). If generated types look stale, ignore it and proceed.
- Do NOT run sleep/polling loops or inspect running processes. If the environment looks off, note it in one line and move on; do not investigate.
- Type the input and output LOCALLY in the .ts to mirror the query below; do NOT import from `../generated/api` (tsconfig `rootDir` is `./src`, so that import breaks the typecheck).
- Trust the Shopify validator for the final check; do NOT read `schema.graphql`.

Use exactly this input query (purchasingCompany is under cart.buyerIdentity, not cart):

query {
  cart {
    buyerIdentity {
      purchasingCompany { company { id } }
    }
    lines {
      merchandise {
        __typename
        ... on ProductVariant {
          product {
            metafield(namespace: "custom", key: "b2b-prebooking") { value }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  paymentMethods { id name }
}

Logic:
- If cart.buyerIdentity.purchasingCompany is null, return no operations.
- If any line's product has the `custom.b2b-prebooking` metafield set, it's a pre-book cart:
  - return a `paymentTermsSet` operation with an event trigger of `FULFILLMENT_CREATED` (due on fulfillment)
  - plus `paymentMethodHide` for any payment method whose name matches the deferred option
- Otherwise return no operations.

Match the deferred method by name. On B2B checkout the underlying name is "Deferred"
(the label shown to buyers is "Choose payment method at a later time"). Keep the match configurable.
```

### While it builds (~2–3 min): talk this through

You do **not** need to open the TypeScript file. Say these two ideas out loud:

1. **Fail open (two guards):**  
   return no changes unless it's a B2B cart **and** at least one line has `custom.b2b-prebooking`  
   *"The function only acts on a B2B cart that actually contains a pre-book item. Every other checkout,
   DTC or available-now-only, passes through untouched."*

2. **When it acts, do exactly two things:**  
   `paymentTermsSet` (due on fulfillment) + hide the method named `"Deferred"`  
   *"Switch terms so payment is due when it ships, and hide 'pay later' so a card gets vaulted, which
   is what lets Flow charge automatically on shipment."*

Two sentences: **only on a B2B pre-book cart, do exactly two things.**

## No deploy needed

`shopify app dev` is already serving this Function (it rebuilds on every save). You don't run
`shopify app deploy` in the session, you activate the **development** Function directly. (Optional
local unit test, no store: `cat src/*.test.json | pnpm shopify app function run`.)

## Activate

Activation is one GraphQL mutation in your **app's own GraphiQL**. In the tab where `shopify app dev`
runs, press **`g`** to open GraphiQL, then run:

```graphql
mutation {
  paymentCustomizationCreate(paymentCustomization: {
    title: "B2B Prebooking Payment Terms"
    enabled: true
    functionHandle: "prebooking-payment-terms"
  }) {
    paymentCustomization { id title enabled }
    userErrors { field message }
  }
}
```

The `functionHandle` is fixed in the starter (`prebooking-payment-terms`), so this mutation is
identical for everyone, nothing to fill in. Expect an `id` back and empty `userErrors`. Full
troubleshooting (`Could not find Function`, scope errors) is in [`../SESSION.md`](../SESSION.md)
("Quick recovery").

## You should see

On the combined (Plus) location, a mixed cart (an available-now item plus a pre-book item)
switches to due-on-fulfillment and hides the deferred payment option; an available-now-only
cart stays on Net 30 with the deferred option visible. The `shopify app dev` tab prints each
Function execution as you check out. Flow (Part 3) then charges the vaulted card per fulfillment.

## Teach (deeper, optional)

- The deferred method's `name` ("Deferred") is not the checkout display label ("Choose payment
  method at a later time"). Match against real Function input, not the visible text. Watch the
  `shopify app dev` output to see the actual input each checkout hands your Function.
- A Function only runs at checkout once a **payment customization** points at it. Only the app that
  owns the Function can create that customization, which is why you activate in the app's own
  GraphiQL (press `g`), not the CLI or a standalone GraphiQL app (those are a different app identity
  and can't see your Function). The stable `functionHandle` means no id lookup and the same mutation
  for every attendee.
