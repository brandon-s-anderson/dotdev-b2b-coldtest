# Follow along

Your single doc for building B2B pre-booking in this session. Keep it open and work top to bottom.
Copy the prompts straight from the fenced blocks, you don't need to open any other file in the repo.

Your prework (store seed, Shopify Payments in test mode, Shopify Flow installed) is already done, per
[`workshop-assets/prerequisites.md`](workshop-assets/prerequisites.md). Background and the "why": the
[`README`](README.md).

Test every checkpoint while **logged into the storefront as your B2B buyer (Maya Cruz)** on the
**Combined** location. The admin preview and normal (DTC) visitors won't trigger the block or the B2B
payment behavior, so always check as the buyer.

## How you work: two tabs

| Tab | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Terminal running `pnpm run dev` | Starts in setup, **stays running all session**. Press **`g`** here to open GraphiQL. |
| **2** | Your AI assistant (Claude / Cursor / etc.) | Where you paste the build prompts. Turn on **auto-accept edits** first. |

No third tab. You don't run `shopify app deploy` during the build, `dev` rebuilds on save.

**What you'll build, in order:**

1. **Data model** — the season the rest of the build reads.
2. **Theme block** — so the buyer sees pre-book windows on the product page.
3. **Payment Function** — so checkout gets the right terms for pre-book.
4. **Flows** — so the store owner can manage these orders and payments automatically.
5. **Non-Plus** — how the same outcome looks without Plus.

---

## Set up the app (Tab 1)

A one-time setup: three commands that register your app **with** the payment-customizations permission
*before* you install it, so activation in Part 3 works the first time.

```bash
cd starter/b2b-prebooking-workshop
pnpm install
shopify app deploy          # creates your app (pick org, name it, release the version)
pnpm run set-scopes         # re-adds the permission the CLI blanks on create, then redeploys
pnpm run dev                # approve the browser install (now includes the permission); press g for GraphiQL
```

<sub>Using npm? `npm install`, `shopify app deploy`, `npm run set-scopes`, `npm run dev`.</sub>

**Why `set-scopes`:** when the CLI first creates your app it wipes the app's access scopes.
`set-scopes` puts them back and redeploys, so your first install already grants the
payment-customizations permission and you won't hit an access-denied error later.

What you'll be prompted for:

1. `shopify app deploy` → pick your Partner org → **create it as a new app** → name it → **release** the version.
2. `pnpm run set-scopes` → it edits the config and runs `deploy` again → **release** the version.
3. `pnpm run dev` → pick your store → **approve Install in the browser** (the consent screen lists
   payment customizations) → enter your **storefront password** if asked (Admin → Online Store →
   Preferences) → at the mkcert prompt choose **"Yes, use mkcert to generate it"** and enter your
   Mac/sudo password (one-time per machine).

Leave Tab 1 (`dev`) running for the rest of the session.

## Part 1 — Data model (in Admin)

The definitions already exist on your store (seeded in prework). You author the **values**: one season,
then assign it to your pre-book products.

### 1a. See the definitions

**Settings → Custom data:**

- Metaobjects → **B2B Pre-booking**
- Metafields → Products → **B2B Pre-booking** (`custom.b2b-prebooking`)

### 1b. Create the season

1. **Settings → Custom data → Metaobjects → B2B Pre-booking → Add entry**
2. Fill in and **Save**:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Season name | `Spring/Summer 2027` |
| Order start date | `2026-07-01` |
| Order end date | `2026-09-30` |
| Delivery start date | `2027-01-15` |
| Delivery end date | `2027-02-28` |

### 1c. Assign the season to the five pre-book products

1. **Products** → select the five titles ending in `(Pre-book)`
2. **Edit products** to open the bulk editor
3. **Columns → Metafields → B2B Pre-booking**
4. Click the first product's B2B Pre-booking cell, **Shift-click** the last one, pick **Spring/Summer
   2027** once, and it applies to all selected → **Save**

**Checkpoint:** a pre-book product shows the season on its B2B Pre-booking metafield.

---

## Part 2 — Theme block

The block reads the season you just seeded, shows the ordering + delivery windows to the buyer, and
attaches those values to the cart line so they carry through to checkout (works on any plan).

### Paste into Tab 2 (your AI assistant)

Make sure **auto-accept edits** is on, then copy the **entire** block:

```text
In this theme app extension, create an app block `blocks/b2b-prebooking.liquid`
with a `product` setting (autofill true).

You only need to edit files (dev is running and hot-reloads); do not run any CLI commands.

Read the product's metaobject reference into a `season` variable from the `custom` namespace:
`product.metafields["custom"]["b2b-prebooking"].value`.

Render only when the season is present AND the buyer is a B2B buyer (`customer.b2b?`),
plus also render in the theme editor (`request.design_mode`) so the block can be positioned.

When shown, display:
- a "Pre-book: {season_name}" badge
- the ordering window (order_start_date to order_end_date)
- the expected delivery window (delivery_start_date to delivery_end_date), formatted as dates
- a short note that the item is placed now and ships in the delivery window with payment due on fulfillment

Use literal English strings for all copy; do NOT use the `| t` translation filter or add a locales
file (theme-check reports false-positive `TranslationKeyExists` errors for app-extension locales,
which is confusing on stage, and this isn't a localization exercise).

Put all CSS in a single inline `<style>` block inside the Liquid file. Do NOT use a separate
`assets/` CSS file or `asset_url` (theme app blocks cannot use the `{% stylesheet %}` tag either);
an inline `<style>` is Shopify's recommended way to ship instance-specific block CSS and, unlike an
external asset, it can't be knocked out by dev-preview asset-URL rotation when a sibling extension
rebuilds. Use neutral colors that read on a light storefront theme, and do NOT add an OS
`prefers-color-scheme` dark-mode media query (the storefront theme controls the palette, not the
visitor's OS).

Add a script that attaches `properties[Season]` and `properties[Delivery window]` to the cart line
so they become visible line item properties. Bake the values into the script from Liquid (`| json`);
do not read metafields client-side.

This is a `target: "section"` block that renders OUTSIDE the product form, and the default Horizon
theme builds the `/cart/add` request from selected fields rather than serializing the whole form,
so do BOTH of these:

(1) inject hidden inputs into the add-to-cart form found at the document level
    (`document.querySelectorAll('form[action*="/cart/add"]')`, not the block's own element),
    idempotently, re-injecting on variant change (`change` on `input[name="id"]`) and section
    re-render (`MutationObserver`);

AND

(2) intercept the `/cart/add` request by patching `window.fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send`,
    and append the `properties[...]` entries ONLY when the request body is a `FormData` whose
    `product-id` equals `block.settings.product.id` (skip when `product-id` is absent or differs,
    so a same-page quick-add of a DIFFERENT product, e.g. "you may also like", is not mis-tagged
    with this product's season).

Part (2) is what makes it work on Horizon; part (1) covers classic themes.
```

### While it builds — what's happening

Two ideas to understand the block (no need to open the files):

1. **It reads the season** from `product.metafields["custom"]["b2b-prebooking"]`, one line, nothing
   hardcoded, so it updates automatically when the season changes.
2. **It carries context to checkout** by writing `properties[Season]` and `properties[Delivery window]`
   onto the cart line, line item properties that work on any plan.

### Place the block

With `dev` still running: open a **pre-book product** in the theme editor → **Add block → Apps → B2B
Pre-booking** → save. No deploy needed.

### Verify (as Maya Cruz on the storefront)

- A pre-book product page shows the windows panel.
- Adding it to cart puts `Season` + `Delivery window` on the cart and checkout lines.
- An available-now product shows no panel and adds no properties.

**If it looks off:** washed-out on the storefront but fine in the theme editor usually means a
dark-mode CSS media query slipped in, remove it. If the block renders but nothing appears on the cart
line, the `/cart/add` intercept (part 2 of the prompt) is missing; check DevTools → Network → the
`/cart/add` request should include `properties[Season]`.

## Part 3 — Plus payment Function

On the Combined location, a mixed cart should switch to **due on fulfillment** and hide "pay later" so
a card gets vaulted. That's what this Function does.

### Paste into Tab 2 (your AI assistant)

```text
Implement the `cart.payment-methods.transform.run` target.

You only need to edit files in `src/` (dev is running and rebuilds on save);
do not run any CLI commands.

Input query:
- the cart's purchasing company id
- each line's merchandise ... on ProductVariant {
    product { metafield(namespace: "custom", key: "b2b-prebooking") { value } }
  }
- the available paymentMethods { id name }

Logic:
- If there's no purchasing company, return no changes.
- If any line's product has the `custom.b2b-prebooking` metafield set, it's a pre-book cart:
  - return a `paymentTermsSet` operation with an event trigger of `FULFILLMENT_CREATED`
    (due on fulfillment)
  - plus `paymentMethodHide` for any payment method whose name matches the deferred option

Match the deferred method by name. On B2B checkout the underlying name is "Deferred"
(the label shown to buyers is "Choose payment method at a later time").
Keep the match configurable.
```

### While it builds — what's happening

1. **It fails open:** no changes unless the cart is B2B **and** contains a pre-book item. Everything
   else passes through untouched.
2. **When it acts, it does two things:** set terms to due on fulfillment, and hide the method named
   `"Deferred"` (that's the real name, not the buyer-facing "Choose payment method at a later time").

### Activate it (Tab 1 → press `g`)

In the `dev` tab press **`g`** to open GraphiQL, set the API version to the latest stable, and run:

```graphql
mutation {
  paymentCustomizationCreate(paymentCustomization: {
    title: "B2B Prebooking Payment Terms"
    enabled: true
    functionHandle: "prebooking-payment-terms"
  }) {
    paymentCustomization { id title enabled }
    userErrors { field message }
  }
}
```

You should get back an `id` with empty `userErrors`. This mutation is the same for everyone (the
`functionHandle` is fixed in the starter).

### Verify (as Maya Cruz on Combined)

| Cart | Terms | "Pay later" |
|---|---|---|
| Mixed (available-now + pre-book) | Due on fulfillment | Hidden |
| Available-now only | Net 30 | Visible |

Tab 1 prints a line each time the Function runs at checkout.

---

## Part 4 — Flows

Two Shopify Flow workflows so the store owner doesn't manage pre-book orders by hand: one tags them,
one charges the vaulted card on fulfillment. Build both in **Admin → Shopify Flow** with Sidekick.

### 4a. Tag pre-book orders

```text
Create a new Flow to tag orders with the tag "Prebooking"
if the order is a B2B order
and the order has a product tagged "prebook".
```

The B2B condition keeps normal (DTC) orders untagged. The product tag `prebook` is what identifies a
pre-book line; the order tag **`Prebooking`** is both a filter for the store owner and the signal the
next Flow uses.

**Checkpoint:** a new B2B pre-book order gets the `Prebooking` tag; a DTC order with the same product
does not. The tag can take **2–3 minutes** to appear, you'll confirm it in the run-through below.

### 4b. Charge on fulfillment

```text
Create a new Flow to charge the vaulted B2B payment method on a B2B order when:
1) the order has payment terms due on fulfillment,
2) the order is tagged "Prebooking",
3) the order due date has arrived.
```

The trigger fires when a payment schedule comes due (for due-on-fulfillment, that's when you fulfill).
The `completedAt` check prevents a double charge. The same Flow works on both plans: non-Plus charges
once at full fulfillment, Plus charges per fulfillment.

**Checkpoint:** fulfilling a pre-book order charges the vaulted method once (you'll see this in the
run-through below).

---

## See it all work together (on Combined)

Flow 1's tag can take 2–3 minutes, so place the order first, then continue while it processes.

1. Compare three carts: available-now = Net 30 with pay-later; pre-book only and mixed = due on
   fulfillment with no pay-later (and `Season` / `Delivery window` on the line).
2. Place the **mixed** order. If you didn't save a card, you're prompted to vault one (the order carries
   terms).
3. Once Flow 1 has run, the order is tagged **`Prebooking`**, filter the Orders list by that tag.
4. Fulfil the available-now line → the vaulted card is charged for that fulfillment. Later fulfil the
   pre-book line → it's charged again (Plus charges per fulfillment).

---

## Part 5 — How this changes for a non-Plus merchant (no new code)

The theme block and both Flows work unchanged. Without Plus:

- Two locations with **fixed** terms (Available Now = Net 30, Pre-book = due on fulfillment) instead of
  one Combined location that switches terms.
- Force-vaulting a card comes from an **App Store app** (custom apps with Functions require Plus).
- No single mixed cart; the two journeys are kept separate.

Your seeded store already has both locations, so you can see the split.

## Quick recovery

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `dev` stopped (`AbortError`), or the block suddenly renders **unstyled** (CSS 404), often right after a build step | Work down this ladder: **1)** restart `pnpm run dev` + hard-refresh the storefront; **2)** if the preview is stuck (`app-preview` errors, edits not landing): `shopify app dev clean` then `pnpm run dev`; **3)** if it says **"CLI credentials are invalid"**: `shopify auth logout` → `shopify auth login`, then `pnpm run dev`. |
| Red `TranslationKeyExists` lines in the terminal | Ignore them (theme-check false positive); the prompt uses literal strings to avoid this |
| GraphiQL says "Could not find Function" | `dev` must be running; press `g` again |
| Activation says `ACCESS_DENIED` / needs `write_payment_customizations` | Run `pnpm run set-scopes` in `starter/b2b-prebooking-workshop`, re-approve the install in the browser, then re-run the mutation.
