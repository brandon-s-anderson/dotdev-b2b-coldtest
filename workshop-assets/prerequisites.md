# Prerequisites

Come to the workshop with these ready so we spend the time building, not setting up.

## Accounts and tools

- A **Shopify Partner account** and a **development store** created as a **Shopify Plus sandbox**
  build (Partner dashboard, Add store, Create development store, choose the Plus sandbox build),
  or a Partner sandbox org. This gives you B2B **and** the Plus-tier features the workshop uses
  (the payment-customization Function's `paymentTermsSet`). A standard/basic development store
  can use B2B but does not expose Plus-tier features, so you couldn't build the Plus parts.
  - **Create it as a United States store.** You pick the store's country when you create it,
    regardless of where you're based, so anyone can do this. US keeps everything in the materials
    consistent: USD pricing (the setup script's price lists are USD), Net 30 / due-on-fulfillment
    terms, the US business address, and the US SSN used in Shopify Payments onboarding. A non-US
    store would change the currency and the Payments identity fields and won't match the scripts.
- **B2B on** (Plus sandbox stores include it; just confirm in **Settings, B2B**, and enable it if
  it isn't). You do **not** need to create the company, buyer, locations, or products by hand: the
  setup step (`../prompts/00-store-setup.md` or the fallback script) creates the products, the
  company **Urban Style**, the buyer **Maria Cruz**, and all three locations for you.
- **Set up Shopify Payments in test mode.** In Settings, Payments, **Activate Shopify Payments** (if
  another provider like a test gateway is already active, deactivate it first), then Manage, Test mode,
  **Enable test mode**. Use test cards like `4242 4242 4242 4242`. Without a card gateway, checkout shows
  no card option and the buyer can't vault a card. Use Shopify Payments, **not the "Bogus Gateway"**: B2B
  vaulted cards are Shopify-Payments-only ([Help Center](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/b2b/vaulted-cards)),
  and the pre-order flow needs the card vaulted and charged later on fulfillment. A Plus sandbox supports
  this. Not scriptable (no Admin API to enable a payment provider), so it's a manual step.
  - **Onboarding on a sandbox:** you click through Shopify Payments account setup first. **Use your own
    name or a made-up one** (not anyone else's), business type Individual, a real-looking **US** address,
    and an adult date of birth. For the SSN, `000-00-0000` and the ad-reserved `987-65-...` range are
    rejected as invalid format; the classic voided **`078-05-1120`** passes. After submitting you'll see
    **"Some of your details couldn't be verified"** / "update your business details by [date]" and a
    Payments banner saying it "isn't processing transactions, select a plan." **All of that is expected
    and ignorable on a dev sandbox**, it only affects real payouts/live selling. **Test mode still works**:
    test cards charge and B2B cards vault. Confirm by seeing the save-payment-method option at checkout.
  - **Heads up on the grace period:** the "update your business details by [date]" notice is roughly a
    **30-day** window, after which test payments on the sandbox can get restricted. So do this Payments
    setup **close to the workshop date**, not weeks early, or it may lapse before the session.
  - **Optional, ACH Direct Debit** (bank-account vaulting, the flows charge card *or* bank): to offer it,
    turn **off Managed payment methods** and enable **ACH Direct Debit**. Card alone is enough for the
    demo, so this is optional.
- **Set payment capture so it is NOT taken at checkout** (Settings, Payments, Payment capture). The
  default, *automatically at checkout*, takes payment immediately and defeats the pay-on-fulfillment
  model. **Either of the other two options works for this build: "Automatically capture payment for
  orders when they're fully fulfilled" or "Manually capture payments for orders."** Both leave the B2B
  payment authorized/vaulted so the charge-on-fulfillment Flow collects it when the order ships; the
  charge-vaulted-payment Flow action behaves the same regardless of which of the two you pick.
- **An email you can receive mail at, for the buyer.** B2B uses **new customer accounts**, so you
  sign in as Maria Cruz from the store's customer login with a one-time code emailed to that
  address. Pass it as `BUYER_EMAIL` when you run setup. You need this to place test orders as a
  logged-in B2B buyer; the pre-book PDP block and the checkout payment behavior only apply to
  logged-in B2B buyers, not to the admin or to D2C visitors.
  - **Tip: use the `+` email alias trick** to run several buyer accounts from one inbox. For
    example `brandon.anderson+urbanstyle@shopify.com` and `+us2@...` are distinct Shopify
    customers, but every login code still lands in `brandon.anderson@shopify.com`. Handy for
    testing different buyers/locations without extra inboxes.
- **Node.js 20+** and a package manager: **pnpm or npm** (the commands in these docs use pnpm;
  substitute `npm` if you prefer).
- **Python 3** (`python3 --version`), used to run the pre-seed **setup script**. Only skippable if
  you provision the store via the AI-prompt path (`../prompts/00-store-setup.md`) instead of the
  script.
- **Shopify CLI 4+** installed and authenticated (`shopify version`). On an older major, upgrade
  with `pnpm add -g @shopify/cli@latest` (or `npm install -g @shopify/cli@latest`).
- A supported **AI coding assistant**: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, VS Code, Antigravity CLI,
  or Hermes.
- **Install BOTH of the following** in your assistant (they cover different needs and don't
  conflict; the plugin does not auto-register the Dev MCP):
  - The **Shopify Dev MCP** server, docs, API schema, and GraphQL validation while you build the
    extensions. **The repo already ships this config** (`.mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, and
    `.vscode/mcp.json`, at both the repo root and in `starter/b2b-prebooking-workshop`), so most
    assistants auto-load `@shopify/dev-mcp@latest` when you open the folder, just approve it if
    prompted. Only add it manually if your tool doesn't read a project MCP file. Claude Code:
    `claude mcp add --transport stdio shopify-dev-mcp -- npx -y @shopify/dev-mcp@latest`.
  - The **Shopify AI Toolkit** plugin, adds Shopify skills and **CLI store-execute**, which the
    store-setup prompt (`00-store-setup.md`) uses to provision your store. Cursor: `/add-plugin shopify`.
    Claude Code: `claude plugin install shopify-ai-toolkit@claude-plugins-official`.
  - All install paths per tool: https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/ai-toolkit
    and https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/devmcp.
- **Shopify Flow** installed (free, from the App Store: `apps.shopify.com/flow`). The two workflows
  (tag pre-book orders; charge the vaulted card on fulfillment) are built in Flow, so it must be
  installed. Available on Advanced and Plus; a Plus sandbox has it. App installs aren't scriptable, so
  this is a manual step.
- **Sidekick** is built into the Shopify admin (no setup needed); you'll use it in-session to
  build the two Flows.
- The **Shopify GraphiQL App** installed on your store, used to activate the Plus payment
  Function. Install: https://shopify-graphiql-app.shopifycloud.com/login (enter your store
  domain; sign in as an account that can install apps, or you'll get a read-only session).
  When authorizing, enable the `read_payment_customizations` and `write_payment_customizations`
  scopes.

## Get the project (clone)

Clone the workshop repo **before the session** (it's small, ~23 MB, mostly the product images the
setup step imports). You need it early because the pre-seed setup step below runs from it, and you'll
build in it during the session.

```bash
# from a folder you keep projects in (not inside another git repo)
git clone https://github.com/brandon-s-anderson/dotdev-b2b-coldtest.git
```

**You install the app's dependencies in the session, not now** (same as the other DotDev workshops).
The first thing you do in the build is `cd starter/b2b-prebooking-workshop && pnpm install` (~100 MB,
well under a minute on the venue wifi), then `shopify app dev`. What you can't catch up on in the
room is the **store setup** (the pre-seed script plus Shopify Payments and Flow), so make sure that
is done well before the session; the clone and install are quick and safe to do live.

## Store data

- **Apparel products.** The setup step **creates these for you** from
  `products/products-import.csv` (10 products, pre-split into **Available Now** and **Pre-book**,
  published to the Online Store, available-now stocked and pre-book at 0 with continue policy).
  Fallback if you skip the script: import the CSV by hand (Shopify admin, Products, Import) and
  keep **"Publish new products to all sales channels"** checked, then run setup with
  `SKIP_PRODUCTS=1`.
- The products carry the tags that drive your collections, B2B catalogs, and Flow conditions:
  `available-now` for available-now products, `prebook` (plus `season:spring-summer-2027`) for
  pre-book products. You can bring your own products instead, as long as they carry those tags.
- **You do not need to vault a card in advance.** Forcing a vaulted card is part of the workshop
  itself: when you place a pre-order test order as the buyer, checkout requires a card, and Flow 2
  then charges it on fulfillment.

## Store structure to pre-seed (before the session)

From the repo you cloned above, first authenticate the Shopify CLI to your store **with the required
scopes** (one time per store, the script fails without it):
`shopify store auth --store <your-store>.myshopify.com --scopes ...`.
The exact scopes string is in `setup/README.md`. Then run the **setup script** (`setup/setup-store.py`,
the recommended one-shot path) to provision everything **before** the workshop, so the in-session
time goes to code. (An optional AI-prompt path, `../prompts/00-store-setup.md`, exists for those who
want to see the Admin GraphQL step by step, but the script is the reliable route.) It creates:

- **B2B catalogs, markets, and company locations** that separate Available Now from pre-book:
  - Non-Plus: two locations/markets, each with one catalog (Available Now vs pre-book).
    Advanced+ allows up to three active B2B catalogs.
  - Plus: one combined location with both catalogs assigned (mixed cart).
  - Every location shares the same shipping/billing address and the same buyer as location admin.
- **Payment terms:** the pre-book location set to due-on-fulfillment; the Available Now location
  on your normal terms (for example Net 30).

The **pre-booking data model is not pre-seeded.** Its definitions live in the app's `shopify.app.toml`
(`$app` namespace) and are created when you run `shopify app dev` in the session; you seed the season
and tag products in-session (see `data-model-seed.md`). Nothing to do here in advance.

## Plan note

B2B is available on **all plans** (Basic, Grow, Advanced, Plus): companies, locations, up to 3
catalogs, net terms, vaulted cards, and Flow ([B2B features by plan](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/b2b/getting-started/plan-features)).
Our "non-Plus" build uses only core B2B that's available below Plus (companies, locations, up to 3
catalogs, terms, vaulted cards, and Flow), so it isn't tied to one specific tier; for simplicity it
links both the Available Now and Pre-book collections in the nav for every location (making the nav
contextual per company location is a nice refinement, but out of scope). On a **Plus sandbox**
development store you have every feature together, so you build **every** part, including the
Plus payment Function. The non-Plus vs. Plus labels tell you what a merchant actually gets on
each plan. The Plus-only differences you build with in mind: the `paymentTermsSet` Function
operation, checkout UI extensions on the payment step, per-fulfillment charging, unlimited and
direct-to-company catalogs. Note: B2B also requires **new customer accounts** and **Shopify
Markets** (enable B2B-with-Markets via feature test drive if prompted).
